## üßπ How the HTML is Cleaned/Purified

The tool employs a robust `purifyHtml` function that meticulously processes your HTML content to ensure it's clean, semantic, and free from common bloat. Here's a detailed breakdown of the purification steps:

1.  **HTML Comment Removal:**
    * All HTML comments (``) are identified and completely removed from the document.

2.  **Attribute Stripping & Specific Tag Handling:**
    * A comprehensive list of attributes known to cause styling conflicts or unnecessary bloat are removed from *all* elements. This includes: `style`, `class`, `id`, `data-mce-style`, `data-font-weight`, `lang`, `dir`, `align`, `valign`, `border`, `cellspacing`, `cellpadding`, `width`, `height`, `background`, `bgcolor`, `color`, `face`, `size`, `role`, `aria-hidden`, `tabindex`, `itemprop`, `itemscope`, `itemtype`, `xml:lang`, `contenteditable`.
    * **Links (`<a>` tags):** Only essential attributes like `href`, `target`, `title`, and `rel` are preserved. External links (`href` not originating from the current domain) are automatically given `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security and best practice.
    * **Images (`<img>` tags):** Only `src`, `alt`, and `title` attributes are retained.

3.  **Unwrapping Redundant Tags:**
    * Specific tags that often carry unnecessary formatting or semantic weight from external sources are unwrapped. This means their content is moved directly to their parent, and the tags themselves are removed. This applies to:
        * `<font>`
        * `<center>`
        * `<span>` (Spans are aggressively unwrapped regardless of remaining attributes, as they are often used for inline styling that is stripped anyway).

4.  **Empty Tag Removal:**
    * Empty block-level elements (`<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<div>`, `<td>`, `<th>`) are removed if they contain no meaningful content (i.e., no text and no non-empty child elements, excluding `<br>`, `<img>`, `hr`).
    * Some inline tags (`<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `i>`, `<s>`, `<u>`) are also removed if they become completely empty after purification.

5.  **Clean-up of `<br>` Tags:**
    * Leading and trailing `<br>` tags within block elements (like `<p>`, `<div>`, headings, list items, etc.) are removed to prevent excessive line breaks.

6.  **Consecutive/Misplaced `<br>` Tag Refinement (String-based):**
    * Multiple consecutive `<br>` tags are reduced to a single `<br>`.
    * `<br>` tags immediately followed or preceded by block-level HTML tags are removed, as the block tags inherently provide line breaks.

This systematic approach ensures that your HTML output is lean, semantically correct, and ready for integration into any clean web environment.
